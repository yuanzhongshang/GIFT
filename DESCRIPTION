Description: GIFT is an R package for efficient statistical inference of conditional TWAS fine-mapping. GIFT examines one genomic region at a time, jointly models the GReX of all genes residing in the focal region, and carries out TWAS conditional analysis in a maximum likelihood framework. In the process, GIFT explicitly models the gene expression correlation and cis-SNP LD across different genes in the region, accounts for the uncertainty in the constructed GReX through joint inference and provides calibrated p values.
