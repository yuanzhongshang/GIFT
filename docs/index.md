## GIFT Overview
![GIFT\_pipeline](Fig1.png)
GIFT is an R package for efficient statistical inference of conditional TWAS fine-mapping. GIFT examines one genomic region at a time, jointly models the GReX of all genes residing in the focal region, and carries out TWAS conditional analysis in a maximum likelihood framework. In the process, GIFT explicitly models the gene expression correlation and cis-SNP LD across different genes in the region, accounts for the uncertainty in the constructed GReX through joint inference and provides calibrated p values. GIFT is implemented as an open-source R package, freely available at www.xzlab.org/software.html. 

Installation
------------
You can install the released version of GIFT from Github with the following code, for more installation details or solutions that might solve related issues (specifically MacOS system) see the [link](https://yuanzhongshang.github.io/GIFT/documentation/02_installation.html).

### Dependencies 
* R version >= 4.0.0.
* R packages: Rcpp, RcppArmadillo, parallel


### 1. Install `devtools` if necessary
```r
install.packages('devtools')
```

### 2. Install `GIFT`
```r
devtools::install_github('yuanzhongshang/GIFT')
